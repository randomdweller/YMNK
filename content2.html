    <p>
      In this crazy unpredictable world, where a single Bat (Or what we are told.) could cause such a large scale global
      catastrophe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">(COVID19)</a> or where someone <a href="https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/rigveda-150-speed-of-light">calculated the approx speed of light, 3200 years ago</a>, not a
      single new thing sounds astonishing to me now. Which brings me to this spectacular image that could mentally break someone's mind (For real).
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      There is an idea in literature called "harmful sensation",
      The idea that a sight, a pernicious idea, a sound, a song, can get into your head and stay there for a very long
      time and do you harm to a large extent.
      Nasty earworms aside, there is a real thing that can get inside your head
      and affect the way your brain works just by looking at it.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect">McCollough Effect.</a> and just a warning: I realize that telling people on
      the internet not to do something is like telling a 5-year-old not to stick beans up their nose,
      they are just going to stick beans up their nose, but seriously: if you work with text
      or video, don't do this.
      <div id="img" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; background: rgb(99, 98, 98); margin: 3vw;">
      <img src="./images/c2/McCollough_effect.black.png" alt="Black McCollough Image." class = "wrapl">
      <img src="./images/c2/McCollough_effect.green.png" alt="green McCollough_effect" class="wrapl">
      <img class = 'wrapl'src="./images/c2/McCollough_effect.red.png" alt="red McCollough_effect">
    </div>
  
      <p>The McCollough effect revolves around these images. If you stare at them for long enough
      -- we're talking anything up from 15 seconds to 15 minutes -- you'll get, as you would
      with, say, blank colors, the opposite appears in your brain.
      If you stare at a green light for long enough, you'll see red for a little while afterward.
      But this doesn't work at the retinal level: the McCollough Effect, for some reason, works
      in the level of the brain.
      You induct these for long enough - 15 minutes - you're going to see the inverse colors
      on those gratings any time you look at something like, say, these railings, all the time, for
      anything up to three months.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The McCollough effect is a very rare thing, it's quite scary, it's a real image that can
      lock into your brain, change the way it works, and stick around for a good while.
      It is a real harmful sensation, and that is something quite scary that you might not have known.
